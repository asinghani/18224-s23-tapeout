# Example Design: Beep Boop Traffic Light Controller

Sequencer for a traffic light with a walk button, with timings tuned to match the iconic 'beep boop' streetlight formerly installed in front of Carnegie Mellon University. Press the walk button and the traffic light will turn red, then the walk signal and 'beep boop' will begin.
