# Testbench

This directory contains PLL_testbench.py, which is a Python file that uses CocoTB to test and evaluate the PLL. The SystemVerilog code for the PLL is provided in phase_locked_loop.sv (which was eventually integrated into src/chip.sv for tape-out). Also, a Makefile is provided for running the simulator; just type "Make" to run!
